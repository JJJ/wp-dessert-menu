# FAQ

### Does this create new database tables?

No. There are no new database tables with this plugin.

### Does this modify existing database tables?

No. All of WordPress's core database tables remain untouched.

### Does this work with other plugins and themes?

Maybe. This depends on how those plugins and themes were designed to work. Many plugins use `is_admin()` checks to make sure their code only executes within the dashboard, which means their menus will not appear when visiting the front-end of your site.
